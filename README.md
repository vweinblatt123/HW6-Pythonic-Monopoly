# HW6-Pythonic-Monopoly

Note, in order to run the dashboard, you will need to include a 'keys.env' file that contains a 'MAPBOX_KEY' value. Then, you can run each block of the dashboard.ipynb notebook. The code below "Serve the Panel Dashboard" will create the dashboard. You can also run in a Bokeh server using the command in the block below that.
It appears sunburst does not play nicely with mapbox plots (unable to hover or zoom on the map) even if they are on separate tabs in the dashboard, so I commented out the former, but you can uncomment to see this tab as well.
